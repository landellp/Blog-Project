          <div class="posts" id="post1"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 1</u></h3><p>I am a veteran of the Vietnam conflict.  I've seen it all, but I didn't put my life on the line fighting these Commies, just to be imprisoned!  My friends didn't die face down in the muck so I could be locked in my home!!!
          There is this thing called the Constitution that is the Supreme law of the land!  Why is no one saying anything about this?  And why is there no tiolet paper in the grocery stores?  Meh, at least I'll have time to catch up on my Netflix shows.<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, signing-off.</div>
          <div class="posts" id="post2"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 4</u></h3><p>Things have been pretty boring around here.  The isolation is starting to get to me.  I've been watching my ex-wife's pomeranian while she and her new boyfriend are on vacation in the Maldives.  I heard they are trapped at the resort
          and none of the workers can leave because of some law they have on the islands.  She'd probably go bankrupt if it wasn't for all the alimony I have to pay.  At least I have a friend to talk to during these trying times. I wuv you, Snickers!<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, signing-off.</p></div>
          <div class="posts" id="post3"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 9</u></h3><p>My neighbor called the cops on me today for working on my van in the driveway.  Welcome to the Communist spy state.  Stinking Stasi neighbor, anyhow.  If I could leave the house, I would just have my oil changed at Jiffy Lube!
          I don't know how Bowling Alleys are not considered an <i>"Essential"</i> service.  I need to hobby.  I think I'll start spying on my neighbors and give them a taste of their own medicine.<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, signing-off.</p></div>
          <div class="posts" id="post4"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 21</u></h3><p>I caught my neighbor going outside to walk his dog!  Has the whole world gone crazy?  Am I the only one who cares about the rules?  I had to restrain myself or I may have bitten this guy's ear off.  I've done it before you know, and my neighbor is no Nihilist.
          I'm going to keep my eye on them.  I know they are up to something.<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, signing-off.</p></div>
          <div class="posts" id="post5"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 54</u></h3><p>I think my neighbor's dog has the Wuhan Coronavirus.  I saw him pooping in my yard, yesterday.  Normally I would pick it up and throw it back in their yard, but I've run out of latex gloves.  I've locked myself in the bunker.
            I fear society has been taken over by toilet paper, bartering war-lords.  I've still got my cameras and security systems setup, but it is only a matter of time before the electricity goes out and the warlords coming kicking in doors - looking for more toilet paper.<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, signing-off.</p></div>
          <div class="posts" id="post6"><h3><u>Quarantine Day 93</u></h3><p>I haven't come out of the bunker for a month, for my own safety.  Unfortunately, I've done a lot of eating out of boredom.  As a result, I've run out of food, I had to eat the pomeranian.  I'm  sorry, Snickers.  It actually wasn't too bad.
          Tasted a little bit like rabbit, not sure what I'm going to do for food next.  I've heard that insects are edible.  One thing is for sure, I can't leave this bunker or I'll get sick.  Stay safe America!<br /><br />Walter Sobchak, Signing off.</div>
